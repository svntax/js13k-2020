# Sandbox Digging Game
A VR game (unfinished) where you dig into a sandbox to find lost treasure. Made for the js13kGames 2020 jam.

## Setup
* Clone the repository, then run `npm install`.
* To start the local server, run `npm run start`. Then you can test the game at `http://localhost:8080`
* To export the game, run `npm run build`, which will bundle the project into a `dist` folder.
